📃 INSTRUCTIONS
============
## 🚀Execution
15 Puzzle uses the folowing Pascal units:
- [Crt](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Crt)
- [Dos](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/dos/index.html)
- [Keyboard](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/keyboard/index.html)
- [Sysutils](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/sysutils/index.html)

To execute it, palce _taquinmain.pas_, _taquinoutils.pas_, _taquinIHM.pas_, and _taquincalc.pas_ in the same folder. Compile the _taquinmain.pas_ file and run it. After launching the program, a terminal windows pops up.

## ⚙️Menu

Everything happens in the terminal. Select the option you want using ↑ and ↓ arrows (or '8' and '2' keys if the VERR NUM buton is desactivated), then press **SPACE BAR** to validate. Any other key won't do anything.

## 🎮 Game

The first step is choosing the level. The higher it is, the larger the grid will be. Commands to play are ↑, ↓, →, ← arrrows to fill the void with a number next to it. If the score is among the top 3, the play will be asked to enter his pseudo to save it. Then the 3 choices are to play again by entering a level, come back to the menu, or exit the program.

## 🥇 Scores
Scores are saved in the _score_15puzzle.txt_ file. If this file doesn't exist, it is created. It is possible to rest scores in the score option.

Now it is your turn to break records !

Thank you for playing 15 Puzzle 🙂
